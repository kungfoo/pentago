# Pentago Multiplayer Game

This was done by me and a few friends like over 10 years ago.
It is an implemementation of the game pentago as a client-server
application.

# Note

This is REALLY old code and I/we will likely not be able to answer any questions on things. :)

There is a lobby, chatting and challenging of people.
Requires java to build and run.


## Building it

    ./build.sh

or

    ./gradlew build
