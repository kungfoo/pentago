# Pentago Multiplayer Game

This was done by me and a few friends during out studies like over *10 years ago*.
It is an implemementation of the game pentago as a client-server
application.

# Note

This is REALLY old code and I/we will likely not be able to answer any questions on things. :)

## Features

- There is a lobby, chatting and challenging of people.
- There are themes
- People can be in multiple games with multiple people at the same time
- Passwords never leave the client or the server (we think)
- Authentication is challenge-response with a challenge signed by the client via use of the password


## Dependencies
